**Describe the solution you'd like**
Lectures are getting saved in impartus as and when it is getting conducted. As student I should able to download all new lectures for my subjects in my specified directory of the per subject in single click. Currently if I want to down load lectures for say 4 subjects I need to go subject by subject. It is time consumming and repeated process. Login credentials, list of subjects and folder for each subject can be specified in the config.json.
